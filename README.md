# React Audio Player

<b>React Audio Player</b> is an audio player that runs on your browser. It came from the need for a browser audio player which I could use during my English classes. It comes with the audio files I use in the classes, but they can be changed.

To change the audio files, put your audio files in the ```public/audio``` folder, and change the ```src/albums.ts``` file appropriately.

The app automatically extracts the title of each track's metadata, as well as its duration. It also shows its waveform.

<b>React Audio Player</b> was written in Typescript, using React.
